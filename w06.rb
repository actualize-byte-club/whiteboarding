# Example whiteboarding problem: Write a function that takes in a string of code with parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets, and checks if the code is balanced with correct bracket syntax.

# Clarify
# Example input: "function(arr) { console.log(arr[0]) }" => string
# Expected output: true => boolean
# Example input: "function(arr { console.log(arr0])"
# Expected output: false
# Expected input: "x(+ [1, {a: 2, {b:3}])(})"
# Expected output: false

# Visualize
# Write a function that takes in a string and prints out the first letter of the string
# Write a function that takes in a string and prints out each letter of the string
# Write a function that takes in a string and loops through the letters, printing the charater if it's any of these: (){}[]
# Write a function that takes in a string and loops through the letters, and counts how many ( { [ there are, and counts how many ) } ] and compares to see if the respective characters are equal
