# Write a function that takes in two strings and prints out the letters of the first string one at a time
# Write a function that takes in two strings and loops through each letter in the first string, compares each letter to the letters in the second string and prints "match" if it finds a match



# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array of the same numbers without any duplicates.
# Example input: [2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 17, 2]

# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and prints it
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and loops through the array and prints each number
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and sets a variable to the first number in the array, then loops through the array and compares that variable to each other number in the array, and prints "duplicate" if they match
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and loops through each number and then runs a second inner loop to compare the current outer loop number with each other number (and print "duplicate" if they match)
